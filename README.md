## Space Warthog!

An Asteroids clone I wrote for a class. Features little thrusters, a crappy custom config file, textures made in paint, and gratuitous amounts of randomly generated fragments with basic asteroid collision when the ship explodes!

Required Libraries: SFML

**Controls:** Only uses the arrow keys. Forward to thrust, left and right to turn, back to shoot.

Note: There is currently no ending scene (the explosion particles took up too much of my time), so if you die just restart the game.
